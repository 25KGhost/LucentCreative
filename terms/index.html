        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

        <p>By accessing or using the services provided by Lucient Creative ("we", "our", or "us"), you agree to the terms outlined in this document. These Terms of Service govern your use of our website and any digital services we provide, including web design, development, and consulting. Please read them carefully before engaging with our business.</p>

        <h2>1. Services Provided</h2>

        <p>Lucient Creative offers high-end web design and development services tailored primarily for agencies, businesses, and premium freelance professionals. All services are provided based on a custom agreement or proposal that outlines the scope, timeline, deliverables, and pricing.</p>

        <h2>2. Intellectual Property</h2>

        <p>Unless otherwise stated in writing, all original design work, code, and content created by Lucient Creative remains our intellectual property until full payment is received. Once paid in full, ownership of final deliverables is transferred to the client, excluding any third-party assets used (such as stock images or licensed libraries).</p>

        <h2>3. Payments & Invoicing</h2>

        <p>All projects are billed according to the terms agreed upon in the proposal or service agreement. A deposit may be required before the project begins. Final files, code, or site launches will not be delivered until full payment has been received. Late payments may result in project delays or additional charges.</p>

        <h2>4. Cancellations & Refunds</h2>

        <p>Due to the custom nature of our work, all payments made are non-refundable once the project has begun. If a project is canceled by the client before completion, a prorated invoice may be issued for the work already performed.</p>

        <h2>5. Client Responsibilities</h2>

        <p>Clients agree to provide necessary content, feedback, and approvals in a timely manner. Delays in communication or content delivery may impact the project timeline. We are not responsible for missed deadlines due to lack of client cooperation.</p>

        <h2>6. Warranties & Limitations</h2>

        <p>All work is tested and reviewed before delivery, but Lucient Creative cannot guarantee that every website or feature will be free of bugs or compatible with all browsers, devices, or systems. We are not liable for any damages, data loss, or revenue losses resulting from the use of our services.</p>

        <h2>7. Ongoing Support</h2>

        <p>Support, updates, or maintenance after project completion are not included unless agreed upon separately. We offer maintenance packages or hourly support for ongoing needs.</p>

        <h2>8. Use of Work for Portfolio</h2>

        <p>Unless explicitly requested otherwise by the client, we reserve the right to showcase completed projects on our website, portfolio, or social media for promotional purposes.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>

        <p>We may update these Terms of Service at any time without prior notice. The latest version will always be available on our website. Continued use of our services implies acceptance of the current terms.</p>

        <h2>Contact</h2>
